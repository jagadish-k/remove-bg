## Why I Built This

Most background removal tools require uploading your images to a server, which raises privacy concerns. I wanted a tool that's:

- ✅ Completely free and open source
- ✅ Privacy-respecting (no uploads, no tracking)
- ✅ Fast and easy to use
- ✅ Available anytime, anywhere

## What Makes It Different?

Unlike AI-powered tools that require server processing, Remove BG uses computer vision algorithms right in your browser. It's specifically optimized for checkered patterns (common in design tools) and gives you granular control over what gets removed.
